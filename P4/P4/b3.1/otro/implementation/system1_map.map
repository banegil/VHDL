WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   pantalla_0/pantalla_0/USER_LOGIC_I/vga/botonDer is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.

Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,687 out of   7,680   21%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,687 out of   1,687 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,687   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,741 out of  15,360   17%
    Number used as logic:             1,962

      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      84

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
