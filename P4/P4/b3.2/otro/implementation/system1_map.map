WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   pantalla_0/pantalla_0/USER_LOGIC_I/vga/botonDer is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    9
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       1,220 out of  15,360    7%
    Number used as Flip Flops:        1,218
    Number used as Latches:               2
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,436 out of  15,360   15%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,501 out of   7,680   19%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,501 out of   1,501 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,501   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,478 out of  15,360   16%
    Number used as logic:             1,968
    Number used as a route-thru:         42
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      84

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 17 out of     173    9%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       7
  Number of RAMB16s:                     17 out of      24   70%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of       8   25%
