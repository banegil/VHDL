Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    3
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       1,237 out of  15,360    8%
    Number used as Flip Flops:        1,213
    Number used as Latches:              24
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,453 out of  15,360   15%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,662 out of   7,680   21%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,662 out of   1,662 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,662   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,527 out of  15,360   16%
    Number used as logic:             1,985
    Number used as a route-thru:         74
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      84

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 13 out of     173    7%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       4
  Number of RAMB16s:                     16 out of      24   66%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of       8   25%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.95

Peak Memory Usage:  4497 MB
